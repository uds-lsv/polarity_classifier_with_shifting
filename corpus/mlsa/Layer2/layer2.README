   Documentation for German Sentiment Corpus:
   Fine-Grained Annotation Layer (Layer 2)
   (Version 1.0)

===========================================================


In this layer, we model the contextually interpreted sentiments on the
levels of words and NP/PP phrases. That is, the annotation decisions
are based on the meaning of the words in the context of the sentence.

Word sentiment markers:

The sentiments on the level of individual words are expressed by
single character markers added at the end of the words.

A word might be positive (+), negative(-), neutral(empty), a shifter
(~), an intensifier (^), or a diminisher (%).

If a word ends with a hyphen (e.g., "auf beziehungs-_ bzw.
partnerschaftliche Probleme-", an underscore is added to the word in
order to prevent missinterpretations of the hyphen as a negative
marker.

Currently, only words that are part of an NP/PP are marked with
sentiment markers. Annotated words are nouns, adjectives, negation
particles, prepositions, adverbs.

The world level annotation was done by 3 persons individually. The
individual results were harmonized into a single reference annotation.


Phrase level markers:

Each phrase is marked up textually by brackets, e.g. "[auf
beziehungs-_ bzw. partnerschaftliche Probleme-]". The type of a phrase
(NP/PP) is not written to the brackets. We follow largely the
annotation model of TIGER for structuring embedded NPs and PPs.

Currently, the following limitations with regard to TIGER exist: (1)
Adjectival phrases are not marked up (2) Relative or infinitival
sentences are not included in NPs/PPs if they appear at the end of a
phrase or if the are discontiguous. We do not only annotate the
phrases which immediately contain words that are marked up as polar.
Any dependent subphrase (NP/PP) is integrated into all its dominating
NPs/PPs, e.g. "[Die tieferen Ursachen [der Faszination+]]". Dependent
subphrases without any polar words are also included, however, there
is no internal bracketing for them, e.g. "[hohe+ Ansprüche an Qualität
und Lage]"

At the level of phrases, we distinguish the following markers:
positive (+), negative (-), neutral(0), bipolar (#). The category
'bipolar' is used mainly for coordinations where negative and positive
sentiments of something are kept in balance by the writer. This is
quite common for a lot of binomial constructions as "Krieg und
Frieden".


File format:

The annotations of layer 2 are delivered as tab-separated text files
consisting of 6 columns (see layer2.phrases.detailed.txt):

- column 1: Sentence ID where phrase stems from.

- column 2: Phrase with harmonized word level annotations, and in the
case of complex NPs/PPs, with subphrase annotations. Subphrase
annotations are attached to the closing right bracket. The sentiment
annotations of the different annotators are separated by slashes.

- column 3: Sentiment annotation of annotator 1 for the phrase

- column 4: Sentiment annotation of annotator 2 for the phrase

- column 5: Sentiment annotation of annotator 3 for the phrase

- column 6: Type of phrase: t means toplevel, s means subphrase. A
phrase of type s has to appear in an other toplevel phrase. Toplevel
phrases are the biggest constituents that are annotated.


Furthermore, to facilitate end-usage, 
we provide a version where the polarity annotation is
based on a majority vote between the 3 annotators. This file 
consists of 3 columns  (see layer2.phrases.majority.txt):

- column 1: Sentence ID where phrase stems from.

- column 2: Phrase with harmonized word level annotations, and in the
case of complex NPs/PPs, with subphrase annotations. Phrase and subphrase
annotations (majority vote) are attached to the closing right bracket. 

- column 3: Type of phrase: t means toplevel, s means subphrase. A
phrase of type s has to appear in an other toplevel phrase. Toplevel
phrases are the biggest constituents that are annotated.
